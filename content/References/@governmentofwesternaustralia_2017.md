> [!quote] Abstract
> In any business there are a number of things that have to be in place and working well if the business is to achieve its goals. These are the critical success factors (CSFs). There might be many day to day tasks that need to be done. But if the CSFs are missing or underperforming, the goals will not be achieved. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the way to measure whether the CSFs are working. Using CSFs and KPIs helps a business stay focused on the key actions that will keep it on track to achieving its goals.
